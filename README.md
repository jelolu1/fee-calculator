# Project Notes and Considerations

There is no explicity indication in that regard, but I considered that the calculation should be only possible if all the fields are fullfilled. This means that a calculation is not possible if cart value, delivery distance and/or number of products are equal to 0, or if the date has not been correctly entered.
