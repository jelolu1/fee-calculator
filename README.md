# Wolt code test

This project has been created to apply for an internship at Wolt

Following the instructions defined in the following github repository:

// https://github.com/woltapp/engineering-summer-intern-2023

I considered that the calculation should be only possible if all the fields are fullfilled. This is an assumption, because it is not explicitly indicated in the instructions.

## Run Code Instructions

The project has been generated using Vite.

I have not included the node_modules folder. Therefore, the first step to run it on a local machine for the first time, it is needed to install the necessary dependencies running:

```shell
npm install
```

Now you can run it executing the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

And to run the test, execute the command:

```shell
npm run test
```
