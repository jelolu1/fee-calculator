## Project Notes and Considerations

There is no explicit indication in this regard, but I considered that the calculation should only be possible if all the fields are filled. This means that a calculation is not possible if the cart value, delivery distance, and/or number of products are equal to 0, or if the date has not been correctly entered.

I have added some additional functionalities to enhance the user experience and improve accessibility, while still staying true to the main objective outlined in the instructions.

My goal was to write code that is self-explanatory, so that comments are not necessary to understand its functionality. I used descriptive variable names, meaningful function names, and structured the code in a way that is easy to follow.
